<h1># FinanceApp</h1>

      <p>
        FinanceApp is an application that enables the simulation of buying and
        selling stocks from the most popular companies worldwide. My application
        focuses on providing a brokerage experience where you can track markets
        and invest in stocks.

          </span>
          <strong>Optimized for All Devices:</strong> The application has been
          carefully tailored to provide a smooth and responsive experience on
          devices of all types. (I'm particularly proud of the mobile version!
          ðŸ˜„)

        <li>

          </span>
          <strong>Limited API Calls:</strong> In the free version of the API I
          use, one refresh/page load consumes 5 API calls. Please be aware that
          there is a maximum limit of 5 API calls per minute in the free API, so
          try not to refresh the application frequently. Excessive refreshing
          may render the app non-functional, and you'll need to wait a minute
          before refreshing again. The application minimizes the number of API
          calls to adhere to limitations, avoiding unnecessary page refreshes.
