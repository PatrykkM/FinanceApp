# FinanceApp

FinanceApp is an application that enables the simulation of buying and selling stocks from the most popular companies worldwide. My application focuses on providing a brokerage experience where you can track markets and invest in stocks.

## Highlights

- ðŸš€ **Optimized for All Devices:** The application has been carefully tailored to provide a smooth and responsive experience on devices of all types. (I'm particularly proud of the mobile version! ðŸ˜„)

- ðŸ”„ **Limited API Calls:** In the free version of the API I use, one refresh/page load consumes 5 API calls. Please be aware that there is a maximum limit of 5 API calls per minute in the free API, so try not to refresh the application frequently. Excessive refreshing may render the app non-functional, and you'll need to wait a minute before refreshing again. The application minimizes the number of API calls to adhere to limitations, avoiding unnecessary page refreshes.
